#This file records:
#
#  1) the name of sensors on the board 
#  2) the sensor type (the hexadecimal number assigned by Aretas to each sensor)
#  3) the channel of the ADS1115 that each sensor is connected to
#  4) the ppm's of the low test gas the sensor is calibrated with 
#  5) the voltage reading that results form the application of the low concentration test gas
#  6) the ppm's of the high test gas the sensor is calibrated with 
#  7) the voltage reading that results form the application of the high concentration test gas
#  8) the slope of the sensors voltage output
